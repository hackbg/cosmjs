# @cosmjs/crypto

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cosmjs/crypto.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/crypto)

This package contains low-level cryptographic functionality used in other
@cosmjs libraries. Little of it is implemented here, but mainly it is a curation
of external libraries along with correctness tests. We add type safety, some
more checks, and a simple API to these libraries. This can also be freely
imported outside of CosmJS based applications.

# @cosmjs/encoding

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cosmjs/encoding.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/encoding)

This package is an extension to the JavaScript standard library that is not
bound to blockchain products. It provides basic hex/base64/ascii encoding to
Uint8Array that doesn't rely on Buffer and also provides better error messages
on invalid input.

## Convert between bech32 and hex addresses

```
>> toBech32("tiov", fromHex("1234ABCD0000AA0000FFFF0000AA00001234ABCD"))
'tiov1zg62hngqqz4qqq8lluqqp2sqqqfrf27dzrrmea'
>> toHex(fromBech32("tiov1zg62hngqqz4qqq8lluqqp2sqqqfrf27dzrrmea").data)
'1234abcd0000aa0000ffff0000aa00001234abcd'
```

# @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc)

This package provides a type-safe wrapper around
[Tendermint RPC](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/). Notably, all binary
data is passed in and out as `Uint8Array`, and this module is reponsible for the
hex/base64 encoding/decoding depending on the field and version of Tendermint.
Also handles converting numbers to and from strings.
